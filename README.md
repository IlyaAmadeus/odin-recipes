# odin-recipes
This is the first project in HTML Foundations of TOP.
It has a main page with links to different recipes. These links contain different attributes, such as href, target and rel.
Each page has a basic html boilerplate as its core structure.
Paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists are used in this project.
There are images of finished dishes with src and alt attributes in it.


In the future it would be great to add a Return to main page link to each recipe.
