        <p>In addition to being a delicious dessert, tiramisu offers the perfect segue when trying to
            steer the Valentine's dinner conversation towards spicier subjects.</p>
            <p>This heady, mood-elevating concoction is rich and deeply satisfying yet remarkably light in texture.</p>
                <p>Yes, you can use regular cream cheese, but mascarpone is far superior.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Â½ cup brewed espresso</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Marsala wine, divided</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, separated</li>
            <li></li>2 tablespoons white sugar</ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir together espresso and 2 tablespoons wine in a shallow bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Whisk together egg yolks, 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sugar, and remaining 1 tablespoon wine in a large bowl over a pot of simmering water until thick, pale yellow, and creamy, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the bowl from heat and whisk in mascarpone, vanilla, and salt until completely smooth.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up to ensure egg whites form sharp peaks. Gently stir and fold 1/2 of the egg whites into mascarpone mixture; fold in remaining egg whites.</li>
            <li>Wrap both glasses in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 8 hours to overnight. Remove plastic wrap and dust tops with cocoa and grated chocolate before serving.</li>
        </ol>
